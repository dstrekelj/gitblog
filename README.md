# GitBlog

GitBlog is a single-page blog powered by the GitHub API. It works by fetching Markdown-formatted articles from a repository, parsing them into HTML, and displaying them on the page.

GitBlog is written in Haxe and targets JavaScript. It is used in my GitHub pages website at [dstrekelj.github.io](http://dstrekelj.github.io). Make sure to read the articles regarding its creation on the same page as well!
